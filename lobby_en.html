                    In recent years, the growth of digital platforms and streaming content have changed not
                    only the way of viewing but also making audiovisual productions. This has also modified
                    the way of telling stories, the interaction with different audiences and the way in which
                    these audiences approach and understand both fiction and non-fiction, including historical
                    facts. Without replacing books, digital platforms have become a way to complement how
                    people learn about contemporary history, nurturing narratives by telling and exposing
                    social realities and complex situations at the civic and political levels.

                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    From this premise came the idea of producing and making <i>Somos.</i>, a fiction series based
                    on the shocking report "Anatomy of a Massacre", which was written by renowned
                    journalist Ginger Thompson about an event that took place in Allende, Coahuila in 2011.

                <p>
                    
                    Somos. was created and produced by James Schamus, producer of films such as <i> Brokeback Mountain</i> and <i>Crounching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,</i> 
                    . He wrote the series along with Mexican nationals Monika Revilla and Fernanda Melchor, and it is the result of a
                    multidisciplinary and creative process. The plot centers around a true story but does so
                    through fiction. In it, a horrible tragedy is told through the voices of its victims, but not in
                    a detached or "impartial" way as it might be done in journalism. Rather, it is humanized
                    by illustrating the habits and customs of a population whose daily life is shown through
                    the complexity of living in a territory in which a hybrid culture is disrupted by the dynamics
                    of the border area between Mexico and the United States.

                    This digital exhibition was created to accompany the launch of this project and seeks to
                    show the principles and creation processes of the series. Three thematic units reveal the
                    process of working as a team, their way of interpreting and considering the facts to then
                    transform them into fiction and create characters capable of telling this terrifying story
                    from a decidedly human perspective.
                </p>
                <br>

                <p>

                    We decided to embark on the challenge of putting on this exhibition knowing that the
                    Covid-19 pandemic would cause it to be presented remotely. Therefore it is an exclusively
                    digital exhibition that takes place within the platform of the Museum of Memory and
                    Tolerance. The virtual experience that we chose does not simulate cultural resources or
                    physical elements, but instead uses language and tools typical of a digital medium.
                    Foremost, in the three sections visitors will find the voices of the creators and promoters
                    of the series with regard to the creative process. In the second unit, photographs coming
                    from the eyes of the production team show how this heartbreaking story was transformed
                    into spaces, environments and images to construct a fictional universe always parallel to
                    real events. The last unit highlights the rich and diverse culture of northeastern Mexico,
                    which is an essential part of the creation of the series and the world of <i> Somos.</i> With short
                    clips and still images, we facilitate a journey through eight themes from the series,
                    bringing the characters to life and fitting them into the story with consistency, while
                    zooming in on the culture of a unique place like Coahuila, just a few miles from the border
                    of Mexico and the United States.
                </p> 
                <br>

                <p>
                    We trust that this exhibition will enrich imaginations, broaden the audiovisual experience
                    and help viewers to understand the creative process involved in these new formats that
                    enable us to enhance culture while generating critical awareness.
